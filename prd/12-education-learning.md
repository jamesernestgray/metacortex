# Education & Learning Module

## Overview
This module acts as a personal learning hub, enabling users to track and organize their educational journey across various platforms and mediums. It connects learning activities to goals and incorporates retention tools to make knowledge stick.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Learning Material Tracker**
    * Users can add and categorize learning resources, such as courses, books, articles, podcasts, and videos.
    * Track progress for each item (e.g., percentage complete, pages read, episodes watched).
    * Integrate with platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Kindle to sync progress where APIs are available.

2.  **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**
    * An built-in, Anki-style tool for creating digital flashcards.
    * Flashcards can be linked to specific notes or learning materials.
    * The system uses a spaced repetition algorithm to schedule card reviews for optimal retention.

3.  **Goal & Note Integration**
    * Users can create specific learning goals (e.g., "Learn Python for data analysis").
    * Learning materials and notes from the PKM module can be linked directly to these goals to track progress.

## UI Requirements

* A dashboard or "Library" view that displays all learning items, filterable by status (In Progress, Completed, To-Do).
* A clean, simple interface for creating and reviewing flashcards.
* Visual progress indicators (e.g., progress bars) on learning items and goals.
* A web clipper browser extension to easily add articles and videos to the learning queue.

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `learning_items`, `learning_progress`, `flashcards`, `review_schedule`, `learning_goals`.
* Implementation of a spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., SM-2).
* A flexible metadata service to handle different types of learning resources (e.g., ISBN for books, URL for articles).
* API endpoints: `GET /learning/items`, `POST /flashcards`, `GET /reviews/today`.

## Edge Cases

* **Diverse Media**: The system must gracefully handle links to external, non-standard content without breaking.
* **API Limitations**: For services without robust APIs (like Kindle), the system may rely on user-initiated imports or manual tracking.
* **Flashcard Export**: Allow users to export their flashcard decks in a common format (e.g., CSV or Anki-compatible package) to avoid data lock-in.
