## Overview
This module is designed to be the central organizing hub for modern families. It provides tools to manage the complexities of household chores, children's schedules and development, and overall family coordination to reduce stress and improve communication.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Chore and Reward Systems**
    * Create and manage dynamic chore charts for children.
    * Implement a customizable rewards system linked to chore completion.
    * Assign tasks to different family members with due dates and recurring schedules.

2.  **Child Development & Schooling**
    * Track and celebrate key developmental milestones for each child.
    * Schedule and manage homework assignments and project deadlines.
    * Keep a centralized list of important contacts (e.g., schools, doctors, emergency contacts).

3.  **Family Coordination**
    * Utilize shared family calendars to coordinate appointments, practices, and events.
    * Support complex scheduling needs, such as shared custody arrangements.

## UI Requirements

* An interactive and visually engaging chore chart, potentially with different themes for younger children.
* A private, timeline-based view for logging and viewing child milestones.
* A color-coded family calendar that clearly distinguishes each member's schedule.
* A parent-facing dashboard to get a quick overview of pending chores, rewards, and the day's schedule.

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `family_members`, `chores`, `chore_assignments`, `rewards`, `child_milestones`, `family_calendar_events`.
* A role-based permission system (e.g., Parent/Admin, Child/User) to control access to different features.
* A robust notification engine to send reminders for chores, events, and homework.

## Edge Cases

* **Complex Schedules**: The calendar must gracefully handle complex recurring events, such as custody schedules that change weekly or for holidays.
* **Age-Appropriate UI**: If children are expected to interact directly with the app, the UI for their features must be simple, secure, and age-appropriate.
* **Co-Parenting Privacy**: In shared custody situations, there must be granular privacy controls to determine what information is visible to each co-parent.
