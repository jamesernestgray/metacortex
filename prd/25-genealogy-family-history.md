## Edge Cases

* **Data Privacy**: The system must strictly manage the privacy of living individuals in the tree, making them visible only to the user or invited collaborators.
* **Conflicting Information**: Allow users to document conflicting sources for the same fact (e.g., two different birth dates).
* **Complex Families**: The data model must support complex family structures, including adoptions, multiple marriages, and unknown parents.
