# Time Management Module

## Overview
This module aims to unify a user's various calendars and scheduling commitments into a single, intelligent interface. It moves beyond simple event tracking to offer proactive time-blocking, schedule optimization, and tools for focused work, directly integrating with the Task Manager to turn intentions into scheduled actions.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Unified Calendar View**
    * Sync with external calendar providers (Google, Apple, Outlook) for two-way updates.
    * Display events from all connected calendars in a single interface (Day, Week, Month views).
    * Allow color-coding or labeling for events from different source calendars.

2.  **Automatic Time-Blocking**
    * Users can drag tasks from the Task Manager directly onto the calendar to create a time-blocked event.
    * An "Auto-schedule" feature that suggests open time slots for a given task based on its estimated duration and the user's existing schedule.
    * Link scheduled blocks back to the original task for status updates.

3.  **Schedule Optimization & Conflict Resolution**
    * The system will flag double-booked events or scheduling conflicts.
    * AI-powered suggestions to resolve conflicts by proposing alternative times.

4.  **Focus & Pomodoro Mode**
    * A built-in timer for focus sessions (e.g., Pomodoro technique) that can be linked to a specific task.
    * During a focus session, the option to mute notifications from the app.
    * Log completed focus sessions in the task's history or a separate productivity log.

## UI Requirements

* A responsive calendar grid that is clear on both desktop and mobile.
* Drag-and-drop interface for moving tasks onto the calendar and rescheduling events.
* A dedicated, minimalist UI for the focus/Pomodoro timer, accessible from the main dashboard or a task view.
* Clear visual differentiation for events, tasks, and time blocks.

---

## Backend Requirements

* Robust and secure synchronization services for each calendar API (Google, Microsoft Graph, CalDAV).
* A scheduler algorithm to analyze free time and suggest optimal slots.
* Tables: `calendar_integrations`, `time_blocks`, `focus_sessions`.
* API endpoints for `GET /calendar/events`, `POST /calendar/timeblock`, `POST /calendar/sync`.

## Edge Cases

* **Time Zone Handling**: All events and due dates must be stored in UTC and converted to the user's local time zone on the frontend to prevent mismatches.
* **Recurring Event Edits**: Differentiate between editing a single instance and editing the entire series of a recurring event from a synced calendar.
* **Sync Latency**: Implement webhooks for real-time updates where possible and fall back to periodic polling, with clear UI indicators for the last sync time.
