## Edge Cases

* **Data Privacy**: The module must ensure the privacy of a user's job search, especially from their current employer.
* **Document Formats**: The system should support common document formats like PDF and DOCX for resumes.
* **Archiving**: Users should be able to archive old job searches to keep the main dashboard focused and uncluttered.
