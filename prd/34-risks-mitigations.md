## Detailed Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Feature Bloat
**Risk**: The platform becomes overwhelming with too many features, driving away users who want simplicity.

**Mitigation**:
- Modular architecture allows users to enable only what they need
- Minimalist default experience for new users
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- User role presets for quick configuration
- Regular user feedback to guide feature prioritization

### Privacy/Safety Concerns
**Risk**: Users don't trust the platform with sensitive personal data.

**Mitigation**:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive modules
- Zero-knowledge architecture where appropriate
- Clear, transparent privacy policies
- Regular security audits and certifications
- User data export capabilities
- Granular privacy controls

### AI Task Execution Unreliability
**Risk**: AI agents make mistakes or take unwanted actions, eroding user trust.

**Mitigation**:
- Start with limited, low-risk AI capabilities
- Always require user confirmation for actions
- Clear AI action audit logs
- Gradual expansion of AI capabilities based on success metrics
- Human fallback options for all AI features

### Context Switching Fatigue
**Risk**: Users find it harder to manage another app rather than easier.

**Mitigation**:
- Deep integrations with existing tools
- Import capabilities from popular apps
- Universal command bar for quick actions
- Mobile/desktop parity for seamless transitions
- Focus on being a hub, not a replacement

### High Development Cost
**Risk**: The project runs out of funding before achieving product-market fit.

**Mitigation**:
- Start with MVP of core features (Tasks + Notes)
- Incremental module development based on user demand
- Early monetization through subscriptions
- Lean development practices
- Regular milestone-based funding reviews
- Community-driven feature prioritization
