# Marketplace & Service Routing Module

## Overview
The Marketplace module extends the platform's capabilities into the real world by enabling users to seamlessly outsource tasks. It connects users with external service providers and creates an internal ecosystem for users to help one another.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Service & Product Integration**
    * For relevant tasks (e.g., "Buy lightbulbs"), the system can link directly to affiliate services or products on sites like Amazon or Instacart.

2.  **External Provider Discovery**
    * Users can discover and route tasks to providers on freelancer platforms like Fiverr for digital tasks or local service platforms for physical tasks.
    * Integration allows for semi-automated creation of job posts on these platforms.

3.  **Internal User-to-User Marketplace**
    * An internal marketplace where users can post tasks they are willing to pay for other users to complete.
    * Users can create profiles showcasing skills they offer.
    * The system includes ratings, reviews, and a simple escrow-based payment system to facilitate trust.

## UI Requirements

* An "Outsource" or "Delegate" option on tasks that opens a routing menu.
* An integrated view to browse and filter service providers or marketplace listings.
* A simple wizard for posting a task to the internal marketplace.
* User profiles with ratings, completed tasks, and skills.

## Backend Requirements

* API integrations with affiliate programs and service provider platforms (e.g., Fiverr, Instacart, Amazon).
* A full marketplace backend system: `listings`, `bids`, `user_profiles`, `ratings`, `escrow_payments`.
* A secure payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe Connect) to handle transactions between users.

## Edge Cases

* **Dispute Resolution**: A clear process and support system must be in place to handle disputes between users in the internal marketplace.
* **Service Quality**: The platform is not responsible for the quality of external providers, but it should curate its integrations and remove partners with poor performance.
* **Liability**: Clear terms of service are needed to define the platform's liability (or lack thereof) for services rendered between users.
