## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Metric Tracking & Logging**
    * Manual entry forms for:
        * Meals, calories, water intake.
        * Exercise type, duration, and intensity.
        * Health metrics like blood pressure, sleep hours, mood, and symptoms.
    * Automated data syncing from connected health services (Apple Health, Fitbit, etc.).

2.  **Medication & Appointment Management**
    * Schedule medication reminders, which create recurring tasks in the Task Manager.
    * Log medical appointments, link relevant notes, and set reminders.

3.  **Goal Setting & Progress Visualization**
    * Allow users to set specific health goals (e.g., "lose 10 lbs," "run 3 times a week," "drink 8 glasses of water daily").
    * Display progress against goals using charts and dashboards.

## UI Requirements

* A customizable health dashboard with widgets for different metrics (e.g., steps today, sleep analysis, calorie trend).
* Simple, quick-entry forms for logging meals, water, and exercise.
* Data visualization through line graphs, bar charts, and progress rings.

---

## Backend Requirements

* HIPAA-compliant data storage considerations (encryption at rest and in transit) for sensitive health information.
* Integration services for health APIs (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, Fitbit, WHOOP, MyFitnessPal).
* Tables: `health_metrics` (a flexible table for various data types), `food_log`, `medication_schedule`, `appointments`.

## Edge Cases

* **Data Duplication**: When syncing from multiple sources (e.g., phone and watch), the system must deduplicate entries for the same activity (e.g., a single walk tracked by both).
* **User Consent**: Implement a granular consent management screen for users to approve exactly what health data the application can read and write.
* **Manual Override**: Allow users to manually correct or delete incorrect data synced from an external device.
