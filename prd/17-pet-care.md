## Edge Cases

* **Multi-Pet Management**: The UI must make it easy to switch between different pet profiles without confusion.
* **Shared Ownership**: The system should allow pet profiles to be shared with co-owners or family members with defined permissions (e.g., view-only vs. editor).
* **Archiving Records**: Provide a way to archive the profile of a deceased pet, preserving the records without cluttering the active interface.
