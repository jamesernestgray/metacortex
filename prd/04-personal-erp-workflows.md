# Personal ERP & Workflows Module

## Overview
This module acts as the high-level command center for the user's "life OS." It allows for the creation of distinct operational dashboards for different life roles and the automation of multi-step processes through a powerful workflow engine.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Role-Based Dashboards**
    * Users can create and customize dashboards for different roles like "Work," "Side Hustle," or "Home".
    * Dashboards are composed of widgets from other modules (e.g., a task list from a specific project, a financial budget status, a habit tracker).

2.  **Workflow Automation**
    * A visual workflow builder where users can create "if this, then that" rules.
    * Workflows can have dependencies, chaining actions together (e.g., When Task A is completed, create Task B and start a focus timer).
    * Triggers can originate from within the app (e.g., task completion, note creation) or from external integrations (e.g., a new email, a calendar event starting).

3.  **Time-blocking Integration**
    * Workflows can interact with the Time Management module to automatically find and schedule time blocks for tasks or routines on the user's calendar.

## UI Requirements

* A drag-and-drop interface for creating and customizing dashboards.
* A visual, node-based editor for building workflows.
* A gallery of pre-built workflow templates for common use cases (e.g., "Weekly Review," "New Project Setup").

---

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `dashboards`, `widgets`, `workflows` (storing trigger/action logic).
* A robust rules engine to process and execute workflows in the background.
* Secure integration with automation services like Zapier or IFTTT to enable external triggers and actions.

---

## Edge Cases

* **Infinite Loops**: The workflow engine must have safeguards to detect and prevent workflows that would trigger themselves endlessly.
* **Error Handling**: If a step in a workflow fails (e.g., an external API is down), the system should notify the user and provide options to retry or fix the workflow.
* **Permissions**: Ensure workflows do not bypass the user's data permissions (e.g., a workflow shared by another user cannot access private data).
