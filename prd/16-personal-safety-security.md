# Personal Safety & Security Module

## Overview
This module is dedicated to enhancing user safety and securing their most critical information. It provides tools for emergency preparedness, secure data storage, and proactive safety measures, all within a highly protected environment.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Emergency Preparedness**
    * Store and manage a list of emergency contacts for quick access in a crisis.
    * Create a simple emergency plan that can be shared with contacts.
    * A "Safety Check-in" feature that notifies emergency contacts if a user fails to confirm their safety by a specified time.

2.  **Encrypted Document Vault**
    * An end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) vault for storing highly sensitive documents like passports, birth certificates, and social security cards.
    * The service provider must have zero knowledge of the encrypted contents.

3.  **Alerts & Information**
    * Integrate with public alert systems to notify the user of local safety events, such as severe weather or police activity.
    * Allow users to store critical medical information (allergies, blood type) for emergency situations.

## UI Requirements

* A dedicated, high-security section of the application requiring separate authentication (e.g., PIN, biometrics).
* A prominent "Emergency Mode" button that displays critical information and contacts on a single screen.
* A simple, non-intrusive interface for setting and responding to safety check-in timers.
* A secure file manager for uploading and organizing documents in the E2EE vault.

## Backend Requirements

* **End-to-End Encryption**: The backend must be architected so that it cannot decrypt user data in the vault, per the PRD's security principles. Encryption and decryption must happen exclusively on the client-side.
* Tables: `emergency_contacts`, `secure_vault_items` (storing only encrypted metadata and file pointers), `safety_check_ins`.
* A highly reliable, priority notification service for dispatching safety check-in alerts.
* Integration with a national or regional emergency alert system API.

## Edge Cases

* **E2EE Key Recovery**: The user must be explicitly warned that losing their master password/key will result in permanent loss of all data in the vault. A user-managed recovery phrase is the only possible recovery method.
* **False Alarms**: The safety check-in feature must have options to easily extend or cancel the timer to prevent accidental emergency notifications.
* **Emergency Access by Proxy**: Consider a secure "dead man's switch" mechanism where a trusted contact can request access if the primary user is unresponsive, requiring a multi-day waiting period and user notification to prevent abuse.
