## Edge Cases

* **Inclusivity**: The module's language and features must be designed to be inclusive and adaptable to a wide variety of faiths, spiritualities, and secular philosophies.
* **Privacy**: Users must have absolute confidence in the privacy of their reflection logs and personal practice data.
* **Community vs. Personal**: Clearly delineate between personal logs and shared community events.
