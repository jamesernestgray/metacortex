# Home Maintenance Module

## Overview
This module acts as a digital command center for managing a household. It helps users track routine chores, log important maintenance for appliances and home systems, manage vendor contacts, and maintain a home inventory.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Task & Chore Management**
    * Create chore calendars and assign tasks to different members of a household.
    * Set up reminders and alerts for recurring home maintenance tasks (e.g., "Change HVAC filter every 3 months").

2.  **Asset & Service Logging**
    * Log service history, repairs, and costs for major appliances and home systems.
    * Store digital copies of warranties, manuals, and receipts for easy access.

3.  **Home Inventory & Contacts**
    * Build and maintain a home inventory, categorized by room or item type.
    * Keep a dedicated contact list for trusted service vendors (plumbers, electricians, etc.).

## UI Requirements

* A shared calendar view for household chores and maintenance schedules.
* A dashboard that surfaces upcoming and overdue maintenance alerts.
* An "Assets" section where each appliance has its own page with a detailed service log.
* A searchable vendor list and a browseable home inventory.

---

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `home_tasks`, `home_assets` (appliances), `asset_service_logs`, `vendor_contacts`, `inventory_items`.
* A notification service to power the maintenance alerts.
* Blob storage for user-uploaded files like receipts and warranty documents.
* Support for multi-user access (family/household sharing).
* API endpoints: `GET /home/tasks`, `POST /home/assets`, `GET /assets/:id/log`.

## Edge Cases

* **Multiple Properties**: The system should optionally support management of more than one property for users who are landlords or own a vacation home.
* **Shared Access Control**: Implement simple permissions for shared households (e.g., Admin vs. Member).
* **Initial Setup**: Provide templates or guides to help users perform an initial home inventory, which can be a daunting task.
