## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Contribution Tracking**
    * Log volunteer hours, the organization served, and the specific role or tasks performed.
    * Store contact information for volunteer coordinators and key personnel at each organization.
    * Upload and store documents like certificates of service or appreciation letters.

2.  **Discovery & Opportunities**
    * Discover local and remote volunteering opportunities based on user interests and location.
    * Integrate with third-party platforms (e.g., VolunteerMatch, Idealist) to pull in listings.

3.  **Profile & Reporting**
    * Generate simple reports summarizing volunteer hours, suitable for resumes, applications, or tax purposes.
    * Optionally share a summary of contributions and total hours on a public-facing user profile.

## UI Requirements

* A personal dashboard visualizing total volunteer hours, broken down by organization and time period.
* A simple logbook interface for quickly adding new volunteer sessions.
* An integrated search and filter interface to browse and discover new volunteer opportunities.
* A clear and simple toggle in the settings to enable or disable the public contributions profile.

---

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `volunteer_logs`, `organizations`, `volunteer_contacts`, `public_profile_settings`.
* Integration with one or more third-party volunteer opportunity APIs.
* A service to generate PDF or CSV reports of a user's volunteering history.
* An API endpoint to serve public profile data if a user has opted in.

## Edge Cases

* **Hour Verification**: While the system will be based on self-reporting, consider a future feature for volunteer coordinators to optionally verify hours.
* **Recurring Commitments**: The system should make it easy to log hours for a recurring commitment (e.g., "every Saturday at the food bank") without repetitive manual entry.
* **Public Profile Privacy**: The public profile feature must be "off" by default and give the user full control over what specific information (e.g., total hours vs. specific organizations) is shared.
