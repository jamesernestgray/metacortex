# AI Assistant / Agent Module

## Overview
The AI Assistant acts as an intelligent layer on top of the entire operating system. It works proactively to reduce cognitive load, automate complex tasks, summarize information, and provide a natural language interface for managing one's life.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Intelligent Task Management**
    * The AI can perform task triage, suggesting priorities based on due dates, context, and user behavior.
    * It can parse natural language input to create fully detailed tasks (e.g., "Remind me to call Mom at 3pm tomorrow" creates a task with a title, assignee, and due date).

2.  **Autonomous Task Execution**
    * Users can delegate simple digital tasks for the AI to execute autonomously (e.g., "Find and book a flight to NYC next Tuesday").
    * All AI-proposed actions (like booking a flight or sending an email) require explicit user confirmation.

3.  **Context-Aware Summarization & Reminders**
    * The AI can provide context-aware reminders ("You have a meeting with Jane in 30 minutes. Here are your notes that mention her.").
    * It can generate summaries of notes, projects, or daily schedules upon request.

4.  **Natural Language Interface**
    * Users can interact with the entire application through a chat-based or voice-activated command bar.

## UI Requirements

* A universal command bar or chat interface for interacting with the AI.
* Proactive notifications that present AI suggestions with simple "Accept/Decline" actions.
* A clear "confirmation step" UI for any action that modifies data or interacts with external services.

## Backend Requirements

* **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4 API with async client for FastAPI
* **Vector Database:** Pinecone for storing embeddings of user data
* **SQLAlchemy Models:**
  * `AIConversation` (storing chat history)
  * `AIAction` (logging AI-executed actions)
  * `AIContext` (managing user data access permissions)
* **FastAPI Routes:**
  * `POST /api/v1/ai/chat` (main conversational interface)
  * `POST /api/v1/ai/actions/{action_type}` (specific AI actions)
  * `GET /api/v1/ai/suggestions` (proactive AI suggestions)
* **Action Framework:** Celery tasks for sandboxed AI action execution
* **Authentication:** Clerk-based access control with per-user AI usage limits
* **Privacy:** Row-level security using SQLAlchemy filters based on user context

## Edge Cases

* **AI Hallucination**: The system must have grounding mechanisms to prevent the AI from fabricating information, relying on the vector search of the user's actual data.
* **Failed Actions**: If an autonomous action fails, the AI should report the failure clearly to the user with an explanation.
* **Ambiguous Commands**: When faced with an ambiguous command, the AI should ask clarifying questions rather than guessing.
