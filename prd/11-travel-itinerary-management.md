## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Itinerary Consolidation**
    * Organize flights, hotel stays, car rentals, and other reservations into a chronological itinerary for each trip.
    * Support manual entry for all reservation types.
    * (Phase 2) Implement an email parsing service that automatically detects and imports booking confirmations from a connected email account.

2.  **Integrations**
    * Connect with mapping services like Google Maps to display all itinerary locations on an interactive map.
    * Allow importing data from services like TripIt or synchronizing events to the user's main calendar.

3.  **Planning & Documentation Tools**
    * Create and manage packing lists using customizable templates.
    * Provide a secure, encrypted vault for storing digital copies of travel documents like passports, visas, and tickets.
    * Allow itineraries to be shared with other users (e.g., family members) with view-only permissions.

4.  **Alerts & Notifications**
    * Send alerts for check-in times, flight delays, or gate changes (requires integration with flight tracking services).
    * Remind users about upcoming reservations or activities.

## UI Requirements

* A main dashboard listing all upcoming, current, and past trips.
* A detailed trip view that includes a timeline/list view of the itinerary and an embedded map.
* A user-friendly checklist interface for packing lists.
* A secure interface for uploading and viewing sensitive documents.

## Backend Requirements

* Tables: `trips`, `reservations` (e.g., flights, hotels, activities), `packing_list_items`, `secure_documents`.
* An integration service for an optional email parser (IMAP) and flight status APIs.
* Secure blob storage with encryption at rest for user-uploaded documents.
* API endpoints: `GET /trips`, `POST /trips/:id/reservation`, `GET /trips/:id/documents`.

## Edge Cases

* **Offline Access**: The mobile app should cache itinerary and document data for offline access when the user is traveling without reliable internet.
* **Complex Itineraries**: The system must handle multi-city trips with layovers and complex connections.
* **Cancellation Handling**: The UI should allow users to easily mark a reservation as canceled and have it update the itinerary accordingly.
