# Security & Privacy

## Overview
Security and privacy are fundamental pillars of MetaCortex, ensuring users can trust the platform with their most personal and sensitive information.

## Core Security Principles

- **End-to-end encryption for notes and sensitive data**: All sensitive user content will be encrypted on the client side before transmission and storage, ensuring that even MetaCortex cannot access this data.

- **Secure API token storage**: All third-party API tokens and credentials will be stored using industry-standard encryption methods, with keys managed securely and rotated regularly.

- **Exportable personal data (GDPR-friendly)**: Users will have the ability to export all their data in standard formats, supporting data portability requirements and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.

- **Fine-grained privacy settings per module/task**: Users will have granular control over privacy settings, allowing them to configure different levels of access and sharing on a per-module or even per-task basis.
