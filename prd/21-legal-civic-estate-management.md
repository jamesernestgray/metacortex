## Overview
This module acts as a highly secure digital vault and organizer for a user's most critical legal documents, civic responsibilities, and long-term estate information. It emphasizes security, privacy, and preparedness for life's major formalities.

## Features & Functional Requirements

1.  **Secure Document Vault**
    * End-to-end encrypted (E2EE) storage for critical legal documents like wills, trusts, deeds, and power of attorney.
    * Ability to add metadata, notes, and physical location information to each document.

2.  **Deadline & Obligation Tracking**
    * Set reminders for important deadlines such as tax filing dates or property tax payments.
    * Track civic duties like jury duty summons and store voter registration details.

3.  **Key Contacts Directory**
    * A secure list of professional contacts (lawyers, accountants, executors) with relevant details.

4.  **Digital Legacy Planning**
    * (Optional/Advanced) A mechanism to securely store information needed to manage or close digital accounts, with a highly secure process for transferring to an executor.

## UI Requirements

* A high-security section of the app requiring separate authentication (PIN, biometrics).
* A clean, searchable list of all stored documents with clear labels.
* A calendar or timeline view for upcoming deadlines.
* Prominent disclaimers and help text explaining the importance of E2EE and password management.

## Backend Requirements

* **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The backend must not be able to decrypt any user-uploaded documents or notes. E2EE is mandatory.
* Tables: `legal_documents` (storing encrypted blobs), `key_contacts`, `civic_deadlines`.
* A highly reliable notification system for critical deadlines.

## Edge Cases

* **Succession Planning**: Designing a secure, verifiable "dead man's switch" to grant access to a designated executor is extremely complex and carries significant security risks.
* **E2EE Key Loss**: The user must be made to understand that losing their master key means their data is permanently irrecoverable.
* **Jurisdictional Differences**: Tax and legal deadlines vary significantly by location; the system would need to allow for fully custom reminders.
