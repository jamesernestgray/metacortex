## Edge Cases

* **Data Synchronization Errors**: Handle cases where a bank's connection is temporarily unavailable or requires re-authentication.
* **Transaction Splitting**: Allow a single transaction to be split across multiple budget categories (e.g., a Target purchase).
* **Data Security**: Security is paramount. Adhere to strict security protocols, including regular audits and never storing raw bank credentials.
