## Recommendations for Phase 1 Completion

### High Priority (Core MVP)
1. Implement Board/Kanban view for tasks
2. Add recurring task functionality with RRULE support
3. Implement note version history API and UI
4. Add Note-Task linking capability
5. Set up Celery + Redis for background jobs
6. Implement basic notification system

### Medium Priority (Enhanced MVP)
1. Add natural language task parsing
2. Implement task delegation workflow
3. Upgrade to rich text editor (TipTap, Slate, or similar)
4. Add drag-and-drop support for board view
5. Implement auto-save for notes
6. Add task history/audit trail UI

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Calendar view for tasks
2. Mobile responsive improvements
3. Import/export functionality
4. Advanced search filters
5. Performance optimizations

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with approximately **60-70%** of Phase 1 MVP features implemented. The core data models and API structure are well-designed, but several key features need implementation before the MVP can be considered complete. The most critical gaps are in the task management features (recurring tasks, delegation, board view) and note features (version history, rich text editing, task integration).
