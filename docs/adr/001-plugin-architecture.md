# ADR-001: Plugin Architecture for Modular Features

**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Deciders**: Tech Lead  

## Context

MetaCortex requires a modular architecture that allows users to enable/disable features to prevent feature bloat and create a personalized experience. The PRD specifies that the system should work like a "life OS" with plugins.

## Decision

We will implement a plugin architecture with the following characteristics:

1. **Module Structure**: Each feature (Tasks, Notes, Finance, etc.) is a self-contained module with its own models, API routes, and UI components
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Modules can be dynamically enabled/disabled per user without affecting other users
3. **Registry Pattern**: A central registry manages module lifecycle and dependencies
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Modules communicate through an event bus to maintain loose coupling
5. **Manifest-Based Configuration**: Each module declares its metadata, permissions, and capabilities in a manifest file

## Consequences

### Positive
- Users can customize their experience by enabling only needed features
- Reduced initial load time and resource usage
- Clear separation of concerns between modules
- Easier to develop and test features in isolation
- Foundation for future third-party module ecosystem

### Negative
- Increased initial development complexity
- Need to refactor existing code to fit module structure
- Potential performance overhead from dynamic loading
- More complex deployment and dependency management

### Risks
- Module interdependencies could create complexity
- Security implications of dynamic code loading
- Versioning and compatibility challenges

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Feature Flags**: Simpler but less flexible, doesn't reduce resource usage
2. **Microservices**: More scalable but too complex for current stage
3. **Monolithic with UI Toggle**: Easiest but doesn't meet PRD requirements

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Refactor existing features to module structure (2 weeks)
2. Phase 2: Implement module registry and loading (1 week)
3. Phase 3: Add user module management UI (1 week)
4. Phase 4: Performance optimization and testing (1 week)
