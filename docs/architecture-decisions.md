# Architecture Decisions

This document records the key architectural decisions made for the MetaCortex project.

## Technology Stack

### Backend: FastAPI (Python)

**Decision**: Use FastAPI as the backend framework

**Rationale**:
- High performance with automatic async/await support
- Automatic API documentation generation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Built-in data validation using Pydantic
- Excellent Python ecosystem for AI/ML integration
- Type hints provide better developer experience

### Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as the primary database with SQLAlchemy ORM

**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL offers robust relational data modeling
- Excellent support for complex queries and full-text search
- SQLAlchemy provides powerful ORM capabilities with async support
- Alembic enables reliable database migrations
- Strong ecosystem and community support

### Authentication: Clerk

**Decision**: Use Clerk as the managed authentication provider

**Rationale**:
- Modern, developer-friendly authentication solution
- Built-in UI components reduce development time
- Excellent support for both React and FastAPI
- Comprehensive security features including 2FA
- Webhook support for backend synchronization

### Task Queue: Celery with Redis

**Decision**: Use Celery for background task processing with Redis as broker

**Rationale**:
- Celery is the de facto standard for Python task queues
- Redis provides fast, reliable message brokering
- Celery Beat enables scheduled task execution
- Flower provides task monitoring capabilities
- Battle-tested and scales well

## Project Structure

### Modular Monolith Architecture

**Decision**: Start with a modular monolith that can evolve to microservices

**Rationale**:
- Faster initial development compared to microservices
- Clear module boundaries enable future service extraction
- Shared database and infrastructure reduce complexity
- Each module is self-contained with its own models, services, and routes

### Repository Pattern

**Decision**: Use repository pattern for data access

**Structure**:
```
- Models: SQLAlchemy ORM models
- Repositories: Data access logic
- Services: Business logic
- Schemas: Pydantic models for validation
- API Routes: FastAPI endpoints
```

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing with mock repositories
- Database implementation details hidden from business logic
- Consistent data access patterns

## API Design

### RESTful API with Versioning

**Decision**: Use REST architecture with URL versioning (/api/v1)

**Rationale**:
- REST is well-understood and has excellent tooling
- URL versioning is explicit and easy to manage
- FastAPI generates automatic documentation
- Supports future GraphQL addition if needed

### Consistent Response Format

**Decision**: Use consistent JSON response format

**Example**:
```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "total": 100
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Predictable response structure
- Easy error handling on frontend
- Supports pagination metadata
- Extensible for future needs

## Development Practices

### Code Style

**Decision**: Use Black, isort, and flake8 for Python code style

**Configuration**:
- Black: 88 character line length
- isort: Black-compatible profile
- flake8: Compatible with Black settings

**Rationale**:
- Consistent code formatting
- Reduced bike-shedding in code reviews
- Automated formatting saves time
- Industry standard tools

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Use pytest with high coverage requirements (80%)

**Approach**:
- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies
- Use fixtures for test data

**Rationale**:
- pytest is the most popular Python testing framework
- Async support for testing FastAPI
- Coverage requirements ensure code quality
- Fixtures reduce test setup boilerplate

## Security

### Environment Variables

**Decision**: Use pydantic-settings for environment management

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe environment variable handling
- Validation at startup prevents runtime errors
- Clear documentation of required variables
- Support for .env files in development

### CORS Configuration

**Decision**: Restrictive CORS in production, permissive in development

**Rationale**:
- Security in production environments
- Developer convenience in local development
- Environment-based configuration
- Explicit allowed origins list

## Frontend Integration

### API Client

**Decision**: Use axios with TypeScript for API communication

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe API calls
- Interceptors for auth tokens
- Good error handling
- Request/response transformation

### State Management

**Decision**: Start with React Context, migrate to Redux if needed

**Rationale**:
- Simpler initial setup
- Sufficient for authentication and user state
- Can add Redux when complexity increases
- Avoid over-engineering early
