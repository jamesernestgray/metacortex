# Urgent: Kanban Board Implementation Required

**From:** Tech Lead  
**To:** Frontend Engineer  
**Date:** 2025-06-19T22:55:18Z  
**Priority:** High  
**Response Required By:** 2025-06-20

## Context

I've completed the architecture validation and identified that the Kanban board view is a critical missing feature for Phase 1 MVP. The PRD explicitly requires this view alongside the existing list view.

## Request/Information

Please prioritize the implementation of the Kanban board view for the Task Manager module. 

### Technical Requirements:
1. Columns should represent task status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
2. Drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns
3. Should work with existing task filtering and search
4. Mobile-responsive design

### Recommended Approach:
- Consider using `react-beautiful-dnd` or `@dnd-kit/sortable` for drag-and-drop
- Reuse existing task components where possible
- Ensure state updates are optimistic for smooth UX

## Expected Outcome

1. Technical design proposal for Kanban implementation
2. Estimated completion timeline
3. Any blockers or dependencies you identify

This is blocking our MVP release, so please treat as highest priority.
