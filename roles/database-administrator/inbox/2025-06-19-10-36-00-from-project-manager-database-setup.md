## Subject: Database Architecture and Optimization for Phase 1 MVP

## Context

The backend team has created initial database models and migrations, but we need your expertise to ensure our database architecture is scalable, performant, and properly configured for production use. The application is expected to handle significant data volume with complex relationships.

## Current Status

- PostgreSQL 15 configured in Docker
- Initial SQLAlchemy models created (User, Task, Note, Habit, Tag)
- Basic Alembic migrations set up
- Connection pooling configured but not optimized

## Request

Please take ownership of the following database tasks:

### 1. Database Architecture Review (Immediate)
- Review existing SQLAlchemy models in backend/app/models/
- Validate relationships and foreign key constraints
- Ensure proper indexing strategy for performance
- Review and optimize the soft delete implementation
- Validate UUID vs integer primary key decisions

### 2. Performance Optimization (This Week)
- Analyze and optimize connection pool settings
- Create missing indexes based on query patterns
- Implement partitioning strategy for large tables
- Set up query performance monitoring
- Configure autovacuum settings for PostgreSQL

### 3. Data Security (High Priority)
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenancy
- Set up encryption at rest
- Configure SSL connections
- Create database user roles with proper permissions
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

### 4. Backup and Recovery (This Week)
- Design and implement backup strategy
- Set up point-in-time recovery
- Create automated backup testing
- Document recovery procedures
- Implement backup retention policies

### 5. Development Support
- Create development and test database setup scripts
- Implement database seeding for testing
- Set up database migration best practices
- Create performance testing datasets
- Document database conventions

### 6. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up PostgreSQL monitoring dashboards
- Configure slow query logging
- Implement connection monitoring
- Create maintenance windows and procedures
- Set up automated health checks

## Specific Issues to Address

1. **Query Optimization**: Backend team reports slow queries on task filtering
2. **Connection Pooling**: Current settings may not handle expected load
3. **Migration Strategy**: Need rollback procedures for migrations
4. **Test Data**: QA team needs realistic test data generation

## Action Items

1. Audit current database schema and provide optimization report
2. Create database best practices documentation
3. Set up monitoring dashboards for database health
4. Provide recommendations for handling future scale

## Expected Outcomes

- Optimized database performance within 48 hours
- Complete backup strategy implemented this week
- Database monitoring operational by end of week
- Comprehensive database documentation

Please coordinate with the DevOps Engineer on infrastructure requirements and the Backend Engineer on model changes.
