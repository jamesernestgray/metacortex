## Subject: Critical Infrastructure Setup for Phase 1 MVP

## Context

The development teams are actively working on Phase 1 MVP features but are experiencing blockers due to missing infrastructure components. We need immediate attention to unblock the teams and establish our deployment pipeline.

## Current Blockers

1. **Backend Team**: Waiting on Elasticsearch setup for search functionality
2. **QA Team**: Needs iOS device provisioning for mobile testing
3. **All Teams**: Missing CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Request

Please prioritize the following infrastructure tasks:

### 1. Development Environment (Immediate)
- Complete Docker Compose setup for all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch)
- Configure development SSL certificates for HTTPS testing
- Set up shared development database with proper access controls
- Document local development setup in README

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (This Week)
- Configure GitHub Actions for both Python and Node.js
- Set up automated testing on PR creation
- Implement build pipelines for FastAPI and React
- Configure deployment to staging environment
- Set up environment-specific configurations

### 3. Cloud Infrastructure (Next Week)
- Provision AWS/GCP resources for staging environment
- Set up Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration
- Configure auto-scaling policies
- Implement infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Set up monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

### 4. Security & Monitoring
- Configure SSL certificates for all environments
- Set up VPN access for production resources
- Implement centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Configure application performance monitoring
- Set up alerting rules and escalation

### 5. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Implement automated database backups
- Create disaster recovery procedures
- Set up cross-region replication
- Document recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO)

## Action Items

1. Review current docker-compose.yml and enhance with missing services
2. Create infrastructure documentation in docs/infrastructure/
3. Set up development environment access for all engineers
4. Provide timeline for each infrastructure component

## Expected Outcomes

- Unblocked development teams within 24 hours
- Fully functional CI/CD pipeline by end of week
- Production-ready infrastructure within 2 weeks
- Complete infrastructure documentation

Please coordinate with the Database Administrator on database-specific requirements and the Security Engineer for security compliance.
