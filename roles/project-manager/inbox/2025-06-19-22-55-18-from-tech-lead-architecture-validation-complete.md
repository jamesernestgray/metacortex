# Architecture Validation Complete

**From:** Tech Lead  
**To:** Project Manager  
**Date:** 2025-06-19T22:55:18Z  
**Priority:** High  
**Response Required By:** 2025-06-20

## Context

I have completed the architecture validation against PRD requirements as requested. The full report is available at `/docs/architecture-validation-report.md`.

## Request/Information

The current implementation is approximately 60-70% complete for Phase 1 MVP. We have identified several critical gaps that must be addressed:

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **Kanban Board View** - Required by PRD but completely missing
2. **Recurring Tasks** - Database ready but no implementation
3. **Task Delegation** - Partial support only
4. **Background Task System** - No Celery/Redis setup
5. **Rich Text Editor** - Using basic textarea instead

### Timeline Impact:
Based on my assessment, we need approximately 3-4 additional weeks to complete Phase 1 MVP requirements.

## Expected Outcome

1. Please review the validation report and adjust project timeline accordingly
2. Prioritize resource allocation for the critical features listed above
3. Consider whether to delay MVP launch or reduce initial feature set

The architecture foundation is solid, but we need focused effort on the identified gaps to meet MVP requirements.
