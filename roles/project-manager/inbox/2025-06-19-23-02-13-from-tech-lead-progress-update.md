**Date:** 2025-06-19T23:02:13Z  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Response Required By:** N/A

## Context

I've completed several high-priority technical leadership tasks and wanted to provide you with a comprehensive update on progress and next steps.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Architecture Validation Report ✅
- Validated current implementation against PRD requirements
- Identified we're 60-70% complete for Phase 1 MVP
- Critical gaps: Kanban view, recurring tasks, notifications system
- Estimated 3-4 weeks additional work needed

### 2. Plugin Architecture Design ✅
- Created comprehensive design for modular feature system
- Documented in `/docs/plugin-architecture-design.md`
- Created ADR-001 for architectural decision record
- Enables user customization as specified in PRD

### 3. AI Integration Design ✅
- Designed complete AI architecture for Phase 4
- OpenAI GPT-4 + Pinecone vector database
- Cost estimates: ~$2,270/month for 1000 users
- Documented in `/docs/ai-integration-design.md`

### 4. Technical Roadmap ✅
- Created 24-week technical roadmap aligned with PRD phases
- Detailed week-by-week implementation plan
- Resource requirements and budget estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies included

## Key Communications Sent

1. **Frontend Engineer**: Urgent request for Kanban board implementation
2. **Backend Engineer**: Critical features list (recurring tasks, delegation, search)
3. **DevOps Engineer**: Celery/Redis setup requirement
4. **AI/ML Engineer**: AI design review request (for Phase 4 planning)

## Immediate Priorities

Based on my analysis, the critical path to MVP includes:
1. Kanban board view (blocking MVP)
2. Background task processing (Celery/Redis)
3. Recurring task implementation
4. Rich text editor upgrade

## Recommendations

1. Consider adjusting MVP timeline by 3-4 weeks
2. Prioritize Frontend Engineer on Kanban view
3. Fast-track DevOps setup of Celery/Redis
4. Review technical roadmap for resource allocation

## Next Steps

I'm continuing with medium-priority tasks while awaiting responses from team members on critical implementations.
