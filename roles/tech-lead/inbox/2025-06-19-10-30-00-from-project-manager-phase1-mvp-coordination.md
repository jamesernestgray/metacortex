## Subject: Phase 1 MVP Technical Leadership and Coordination

## Context

I've reviewed the current project status and identified that while individual engineers are making progress on their tasks, we need stronger technical coordination for the Phase 1 MVP. The project is focusing on Tasks + Notes functionality as outlined in our PRD.

## Current Status

- Backend Engineer: Working on auth APIs, caching, and API v2 migration
- Frontend Engineer: Implementing checkout flow, dark mode, and React conversions
- QA Engineer: Active testing on v2.5 release and payment systems
- DevOps and DBA: No current tasks assigned despite being dependencies for other teams

## Request

Please take ownership of the following Phase 1 MVP coordination tasks:

1. **Technical Architecture Review**
   - Review and approve the modular plugin system design
   - Ensure API-first design principles are being followed
   - Validate the microservice-compatible architecture

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Create technical sprint plan for Phase 1 MVP completion
   - Identify critical path items and dependencies
   - Coordinate with Backend and Frontend on integration points

3. **Team Unblocking**
   - Address Backend's Elasticsearch blocker with DevOps
   - Resolve Frontend's mobile deep linking dependency
   - Coordinate security reviews for payment gateway

4. **Technical Standards**
   - Establish coding standards across teams
   - Review and approve API design patterns
   - Set up architecture decision records (ADRs)

5. **Phase 1 Core Modules**
   - Task Manager implementation strategy
   - Notes & PKM system architecture
   - Dashboard & Workflows technical design

## Action Items

1. Review current implementation status in backend/ and frontend/ directories
2. Create technical roadmap for Phase 1 completion
3. Schedule architecture review sessions with engineering teams
4. Prioritize unblocking current team dependencies

## Expected Outcomes

- Clear technical direction for Phase 1 MVP
- Unblocked engineering teams
- Aligned architecture across all components
- Timeline for Phase 1 completion

Please acknowledge receipt and provide initial thoughts on approach by EOD tomorrow.

Best regards,  
Project Manager
