# AI Integration Design Ready for Review

**From:** Tech Lead  
**To:** AI/ML Engineer  
**Date:** 2025-06-19T23:01:31Z  
**Priority:** High  
**Response Required By:** N/A (Phase 4 - planning ahead)

## Context

I've created the technical design document for AI integration in MetaCortex, covering OpenAI GPT-4 and Pinecone vector database integration. While this is planned for Phase 4, I wanted to share it early to get your input on the architecture.

## Request/Information

Please review the AI integration design document and provide feedback on:

1. **Architecture Appropriateness**
   - Is the proposed architecture scalable and efficient?
   - Any concerns about the vector store design?

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Review the cost estimates ($2,270/month for 1000 users)
   - Suggest additional optimization strategies

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Embedding generation pipeline
   - Context retrieval approach
   - Autonomous task execution framework

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Data isolation in vector searches
   - Rate limiting approach
   - Privacy concerns with AI processing user data

## Expected Outcome

Your expertise will help ensure we build a robust AI system when we reach Phase 4. No immediate implementation needed, but early feedback will help refine the design.
