## Subject: Critical Backend Features for Phase 1 MVP Completion

## Context

Great progress on the initial API structure! We need to complete the remaining backend features for Phase 1 MVP. Based on the task list review, several critical features need immediate attention to support the frontend team's work.

## Current Gaps

Based on tasks.md analysis:
- Clerk authentication integration incomplete
- Background task queue not configured
- Missing error handling and logging setup
- Several API endpoints need authorization
- Rate limiting not implemented

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Complete Clerk Authentication (Blocker - This Week)
- [ ] Install Clerk SDK for Python: `poetry add clerk-backend-api`
- [ ] Configure Clerk webhook endpoints for user sync
- [ ] Implement Clerk JWT verification middleware
- [ ] Add user context to all protected endpoints
- [ ] Create user profile sync with local database
- [ ] Test OAuth flows (Google, Apple)

### 2. Background Task Queue Setup (This Week)
- [ ] Install and configure Celery with Redis
- [ ] Create Celery app with FastAPI integration
- [ ] Implement email notification tasks
- [ ] Set up task scheduling for recurring habits
- [ ] Configure Celery Beat for scheduled tasks
- [ ] Add task monitoring with Flower

### 3. Error Handling & Logging (Immediate)
- [ ] Configure structured logging with loguru
- [ ] Implement global exception handlers
- [ ] Add request ID middleware for tracing
- [ ] Set up Sentry integration for production
- [ ] Create custom exception classes
- [ ] Add API error response standards

### 4. API Security Enhancements (This Week)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting with slowapi
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Configure CORS properly for production
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for webhooks
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention measures
- [ ] Set up security headers

### 5. Complete Missing Endpoints
- [ ] Task bulk operations (update/delete)
- [ ] Task history/audit log endpoints
- [ ] Note templates CRUD operations
- [ ] Habit reminders configuration
- [ ] User preferences endpoints
- [ ] Dashboard data aggregation endpoints

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add database query optimization
- [ ] Configure async database operations properly
- [ ] Implement pagination for all list endpoints
- [ ] Add response compression

## Testing Requirements

- Write pytest tests for all new endpoints
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Add integration tests for Clerk webhooks
- Create performance benchmarks

## Documentation Needs

- Update API documentation with authentication details
- Document background task usage
- Create error code reference
- Add deployment configuration guide

## Coordination Points

- Work with Frontend Engineer on API contracts
- Coordinate with DevOps on Redis/Celery setup
- Align with Security Engineer on security measures
- Sync with QA on testing requirements

Please update your tasks.md with progress and any blockers you encounter.
