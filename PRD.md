* A user-friendly dashboard editor with a grid layout and a sidebar containing all available widgets for drag-and-drop placement.
* A simple interface for previewing and applying user role presets, with a clear warning that it may change the current layout.

---

#### **Backend Requirements**

* The architecture should be inherently modular, using microservices or clearly separated code libraries for each module to facilitate independent development and deployment.
* A `user_module_settings` table to store the enabled/disabled state of each module for each user.
* A flexible schema for dashboards (e.g., using JSONB in PostgreSQL) to store the layout, type, and configuration of widgets for each dashboard.
* A versioned, public-facing API to support the future developer plugin system.

---

#### **Edge Cases**

* **Module Dependencies**: If a user attempts to disable a module that another enabled module relies on (e.g., disabling Tasks when the Calendar uses it), the system must provide a clear warning and explain the consequences.
* **Data Retention Policy**: When a module is disabled, the system should inform the user that their data is being retained but will be inaccessible. An option to permanently delete all data from a disabled module should also be provided to comply with data privacy principles.
* **Preset Overwrites**: Applying a role preset should prompt the user, warning them that it will overwrite their current dashboard layouts and module settings, and offer an option to cancel.

### **6. Integrations ‚Äì Expanded Requirements**

#### **Overview**
Integrations are fundamental to MetaCortex's mission of being a centralized hub. Instead of replacing every tool, the platform aims to connect with the user's existing ecosystem of apps and services. This reduces context switching fatigue, automates data flow, and ensures MetaCortex acts as a true "life OS" that brings information together.

---

#### **Features & Functional Requirements**

1.  **Centralized Connection Management**
    * A single "Integrations" page in the settings where users can view, connect, disconnect, and manage permissions for all third-party applications.
    * Each integration must use a secure authorization method, primarily OAuth2, to ensure the user's credentials are not stored on MetaCortex servers.

2.  **Productivity & Automation Integrations**
    * **Calendars:** Two-way synchronization with Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar. Events from external calendars appear in MetaCortex, and tasks with due dates can be pushed out.
    * **Automation Platforms:** Native integration with Zapier and IFTTT to allow for a virtually unlimited range of custom workflows.
    * **Task/Note Apps:** Provide import/export or sync functionality with popular tools like Notion, Trello, and Todoist to help new users migrate or to work in parallel.

3.  **Data-Specific Integrations**
    * **Finance:** Connect with financial data aggregators like Plaid to pull in transaction and balance data for the Financial Management module. This is a read-only connection.
    * **Health:** Integrate with platforms like Apple Health, Fitbit, and MyFitnessPal to automatically populate the Health, Diet & Fitness module with activity, sleep, and nutrition data.
    * **Shopping & Services:** Link with services like Amazon and Instacart for affiliate product suggestions or to streamline task delegation.
    * **Learning:** Connect with Kindle (for highlights), Coursera (for course progress), and YouTube (for watch history) to populate the Education & Learning module.

---

#### **UI Requirements**

* An Integrations page designed as a gallery, with a card for each available service showing its logo, a brief description, and a "Connect" button.
* Connected services should clearly display their status and provide options to "Manage Settings" or "Disconnect."
* The platform must use clear, standardized OAuth consent screens that explicitly state what data is being requested and what permissions are being granted.

---

#### **Backend Requirements**

* **SQLAlchemy Models:**
  * `Integration` (available integrations catalog)
  * `UserIntegration` (user-specific integration settings)
  * `IntegrationToken` (encrypted OAuth tokens and API keys)
* **FastAPI Routes:**
  * `GET /api/v1/integrations` (list available integrations)
  * `POST /api/v1/integrations/{integration_id}/connect`
  * `DELETE /api/v1/integrations/{integration_id}/disconnect`
  * `POST /api/v1/integrations/{integration_id}/sync`
* **Security:** 
  * Encrypted token storage using SQLAlchemy hybrid properties
  * Clerk webhooks for user deletion to clean up integration data
* **Architecture:** Adapter pattern with separate modules per integration
* **Background Jobs:** Celery tasks for:
  * Scheduled data synchronization
  * Rate limit management with Redis-based counters
  * OAuth token refresh handling

---

#### **Edge Cases**

* **API Rate Limiting**: The system must intelligently manage its API calls to third-party services to stay within their specified rate limits to avoid being blocked.
* **Authentication Failure**: If an API token expires or is revoked, the system must handle the error gracefully, pause the relevant data syncs, and notify the user to re-authenticate the connection.
* **Data Mapping**: When data from an external service does not perfectly match the MetaCortex data model, the system should have a defined strategy for mapping the data as closely as possible and logging any unmappable fields.

### **7. Technical Requirements ‚Äì Expanded Requirements**

#### **Overview**
The technical architecture of MetaCortex is designed to support its core product principles: modularity, security, and long-term extensibility. The chosen stack and architectural patterns aim to provide a scalable and reliable foundation, enabling a responsive user experience while allowing for the continuous addition of new features and integrations.

---

### **7.1 Stack ‚Äì Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Frontend (Web)**
* **Framework:** React.
    * **Justification:** React's component-based model is a natural fit for MetaCortex's modular design, allowing UI elements from different modules to be composed seamlessly into dashboards. Its large ecosystem and community support ensure access to a wide range of libraries and talent.
* **State Management:** A predictable, centralized state management solution like Redux Toolkit or Zustand will be used to manage complex application state, especially for user settings, notifications, and cross-module data.
* **Styling:** A solution that supports theming and customization, such as CSS-in-JS (e.g., Styled Components) or a utility-first framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS), will be implemented to support light/dark modes and user personalization.

#### **Frontend (Mobile)**
* **Framework:** React Native.
    * **Justification:** This choice enables significant code sharing (components, business logic) with the web application, accelerating development and ensuring feature parity across platforms. It also provides full access to native device capabilities required for features like push notifications and Health/HealthKit integrations.

#### **Backend**
* **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
    * **Justification:** FastAPI provides high performance with automatic data validation and API documentation through OpenAPI/Swagger. Its Python foundation enables seamless integration with AI/ML libraries for the AI Assistant module. The framework's async support and dependency injection system align well with the modular architecture requirements.
    * **Key Features:** Automatic request/response validation with Pydantic, built-in API documentation, async/await support, and excellent performance benchmarks.

#### **Database**
* **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL.
    * **Justification:** PostgreSQL's reliability, powerful indexing, and support for extensions like PostGIS (for future location features) and full-text search make it a robust choice. Its relational nature is ideal for the highly structured data in the app (tasks, notes, financial transactions, etc.).
* **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** SQLAlchemy with async support.
    * **Justification:** SQLAlchemy is the most mature and feature-rich ORM for Python, with excellent PostgreSQL support. Its async capabilities (via asyncpg) align with FastAPI's async nature, enabling high-performance database operations. The ORM provides powerful query building, relationship management, and migration support through Alembic.

#### **AI Infrastructure**
* **LLM Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4 is the specified model for advanced natural language understanding and generation.
* **Vector Database:** A vector DB such as Pinecone is required.
    * **Implementation:** This will be used to store vector embeddings of the user's notes, tasks, and other personal data. When a user queries the AI Assistant, the query is first used to perform a semantic search on this vector DB to retrieve relevant context. This context is then passed to the LLM, resulting in highly personalized and accurate responses while preventing the AI from accessing irrelevant data.

#### **Authentication**
* **Strategy:** Implement OAuth2 for third-party logins (Google, Apple), passwordless magic links, and support for multi-factor authentication (2FA).
* **Implementation:** Clerk will be used as the managed authentication service.
    * **Justification:** Clerk provides a modern, developer-friendly authentication solution with excellent support for both React and FastAPI. It offers built-in user management UI components, webhook support for backend synchronization, comprehensive security features including 2FA, and seamless OAuth provider integration. Clerk's SDK reduces authentication complexity while maintaining security best practices.

---

### **7.2 Architecture ‚Äì Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Modular Plugin System**
* **Description:** This is the core architectural concept. Each module (e.g., "Finance," "Health") will be developed as a self-contained package. This package will include its own API routes, database schema (migrations), and frontend components. The core application will act as a shell that dynamically loads and integrates these modules based on each user's settings, ensuring disabled modules consume no resources.

#### **Microservice-Compatible Backend**
* **Description:** While likely starting as a "modular monolith" for development simplicity, the backend will be designed to be microservice-compatible. Code will be strictly separated by domain (e.g., `task-service`, `auth-service`, `notifications-service`). This clear separation of concerns ensures that if a specific domain experiences high load (e.g., AI processing), it can be broken out into its own independently scalable microservice without requiring a full application rewrite.

#### **Background Task Queue**
* **System:** Celery with Redis as the message broker.
    * **Justification:** Celery is the de facto standard for Python task queues, with mature ecosystem support and excellent FastAPI integration. Redis provides fast, reliable message brokering and result storage. This combination is battle-tested and scales well.
* **Use Cases:** This is critical for offloading any long-running or asynchronous operations from the main application thread to maintain UI responsiveness. Key uses include:
    * Sending email and push notifications.
    * Processing data syncs with third-party APIs.
    * Generating AI summaries or performing other AI-related computations.
    * Running scheduled jobs with Celery Beat, like daily financial data aggregation or habit streak calculations.
    * Monitoring via Flower for task visibility and debugging.

#### **API-First Design**
* **Description:** The entire backend will be built as a set of well-documented REST APIs using FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation. The web and mobile applications are the primary "clients" of this API. This approach enforces a clean separation between the frontend and backend, allows for independent development cycles, and makes it straightforward to add new clients (e.g., a desktop app, third-party integrations) in the future.
* **Implementation:** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc), ensuring the API is self-documenting. All endpoints will follow RESTful conventions with consistent URL patterns (/api/v1/resource), standard HTTP methods, and Pydantic models for request/response validation.

### **8. UX/UI Principles ‚Äì Expanded Requirements**

#### **Overview**
The following principles are the foundation of the MetaCortex user experience. They serve as a guide for all design and development decisions to ensure the application is intuitive, powerful, accessible, and consistent across all platforms.

---

#### **1. Minimalist by default, customizable by power users**
This principle addresses the risk of feature bloat by ensuring the application is approachable for new users while offering the depth required by power users.

* **Minimalist Default Experience:**
    * **Onboarding:** A new user's initial view will be clean and focused, starting with only the core Task and Notes modules enabled.
    * **Interface:** The default UI will prioritize clear typography, generous whitespace, and a limited color palette to reduce cognitive load and create a calm, focused environment.
    * **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features and options will be kept out of the main interface, accessible through context menus or settings panels, so they don't overwhelm new users.

* **Power User Customization:**
    * **Information Density:** Users will have settings to control information density, such as a "compact mode" to see more tasks or notes on the screen at once.
    * **Custom Dashboards:** Power users can build information-rich dashboards with widgets from any enabled module, arranging them to suit their unique workflow.
    * **Advanced Controls:** Features like complex filtering, custom field creation, and detailed workflow automation will be available for users who want to move beyond the basics.

---

#### **2. Command bar (universal quick action/search)**
The command bar is a central interaction model designed for speed and efficiency. It provides a single point of entry for navigation, search, and actions.

* **Core Functionality:** Accessible via a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Cmd/Ctrl + K`), the command bar allows users to perform most actions without leaving the keyboard.
* **Universal Search:** Instantly search across all modules‚Äîtasks, notes, projects, contacts, calendar events, etc.‚Äîfrom one interface.
* **Quick Actions:** Execute commands through natural language, such as "new task," "delegate 'Call plumber' to AI," "go to calendar," or "toggle dark mode."
* **Context-Aware Suggestions:** The command bar will intelligently suggest relevant actions based on the user's current view. For example, if viewing a note, it will suggest "link to task" or "add tag."

---

#### **3. Accessibility-first**
Accessibility is a non-negotiable requirement, ensuring the application is usable by people with a wide range of abilities. The platform will be designed and built in accordance with modern accessibility standards.

* **WCAG Compliance:** The application will target compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
* **Specific Implementations:**
    * **Screen Reader Support:** All interactive elements, icons, and images will have proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML to be fully understandable by screen readers.
    * **Keyboard Navigation:** Every action and piece of content must be navigable and operable using only a keyboard. Focus states will be highly visible.
    * **Color & Contrast:** All color combinations for text and UI elements will meet minimum contrast ratios. A high-contrast theme will also be available.
    * **Readability:** Text will be scalable, and layouts will be responsive to ensure content remains readable when zoomed.

---

#### **4. Mobile and desktop parity**
The mobile application will be a first-class citizen, not a limited "lite" version of the desktop experience. Users should be able to perform any core function on any device.

* **Consistent Capabilities:** All core features developed for the web/desktop application will be simultaneously planned and implemented for the mobile app whenever feasible.
* **Adaptive UX:** While maintaining feature parity, the user experience will be adapted to the specific platform. For example, hover-based interactions on desktop will be translated to touch-friendly patterns like long-presses on mobile.
* **Offline Functionality:** The mobile app will be designed for robust offline use. Users can create, view, and edit items like tasks and notes while offline, with changes syncing automatically and intelligently once a connection is re-established.

---

#### **5. Light/dark theme support**
To accommodate user preference and reduce eye strain in different lighting conditions, the application will fully support both light and dark themes.

* **Implementation:** Users can manually select their preferred theme or set it to sync automatically with their operating system's appearance setting.
* **Theming Engine:** The styling will be built on a system of design tokens (variables for colors, spacing, etc.) to ensure that all components, including those from future modules, adhere to the selected theme.
